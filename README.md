# Credit_Card_Approval_Prediction
A project that contains the steps for predicting credit card approval

Money may not always be at our disposal but it is often needed. Knowing who it is useful for and who would need it could be challenging.

Going through all the data to find that out could be tiring and maybe misleading but why stress when it can be automated and we can be assisted by machine learning models
With the proper machine learning algorithm we decipher which customer or person who needs a loan would get approved

It is one thing to need a loan and it is another thing to get an approval.

This repository contains a jupyter notebook that uses python code to analyze the data and make predictions

Logistic Regression was the best to make prediction for continious data and with the metrics used to grade its performance it did perform excellently well
